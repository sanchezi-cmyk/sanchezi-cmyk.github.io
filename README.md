## Data Sources and Project Ideas

All data sets were extracted from Kaggle.

* ### [Coffee Shop Sales Insights](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kainatjamil12/coffe-sale):

This dataset comprises individual transaction records from a coffee shop. It includes columns for the date and time of sale (including hour, day, and month), the name of the coffee product sold (coffee_name), the payment method (cash_type), and the revenue generated for that transaction (money). It provides all the necessary details to explore consumer buying patterns and sales trends.  
  
  My idea with this data set is to analyze it and identify the most profitable months, days, and hours of operation. Then, determine the proportion of revenue contributed by specific coffee products during those peak periods.

* ### [Crime & Consequence: A Metropolitan Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/har5hdeep5harma/chicago-crime-incidents-2001-to-present/data):

This expansive dataset contains over 8.4 million individual crime reports from the City of Chicago, covering a two-decade span from 2001 to the present. Sourced from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR system, each record provides crucial details on an incident, including the precise date and time of occurrence, the primary type of crime (e.g., Theft, Battery), the specific location description (e.g., Street, Residence), and geographical coordinates (Latitude, Longitude).  

   With this data set, I want to analyze trends. The primary focus will be to track the volume of crime yearly, identify the single highest-volume crime category in the city for each year, and ultimately discover potential temporal and spatial correlations between specific crime types, their years of occurrence, and their location across Chicago's community areas.

 * ### [Game Recommendations on Steam](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam)

This dataset provides comprehensive information on over 50,000 games and add-ons from the Steam digital distribution platform. It is structured across three primary files: one detailing game metadata (ratings, pricing in US dollars, release dates), a second containing anonymized user profiles (number of purchased products and reviews), and a third massive file containing user recommendations (reviews) which links specific users to their product reviews. Collectively, these files enable the study of user behavior, product success factors, and the construction of personalized recommendation systems.  

 I have 2 different ideas for this data set. The first one is to determine the genres with the highest commercial success and positive reception on Steam, could even compare different genres and see how it affects. The second idea is to focus on the relationship between user's activity and their review behavior (if they leave a review or not). For example, analyze whether the number of purchased products correlates with the likelihood of leaving a positive recommendation (maybe even do a model?).

 * ### [Analyzing Customer Tipping Patterns](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varishabatool/tip-prediction-dataset/data)

This dataset is a collection of restaurant transaction records. It contains details for 244 dining parties, linking the total bill amount and the tip amount to various categorical and quantitative factors. These factors include customer demographics and dining context, such as the gender of the bill payer, whether the party includes a smoker, the day of the week (Thursday through Sunday), the mealtime (lunch or dinner), and the size (number of guests) of the party.  

 My idea with this data set is to see if there's a correlation between the variables. I would definitely be testing all the variables, but I would be specifically interested in using number of guests and gender of the bill payer, I think it could be interesting.

## Final Project Data Science

This project examines the evolution of crime in Chicago over the past two decades. We utilize heatmaps and time-series data to visualize changing neighborhood hotspots and fluctuations in crime types from 2001 to the present.  
Here is my [Crime Analysis Project.](https://sanchezi-cmyk.github.io/Crime_Analysis_Chicago/).

### Data Sources and Project Ideas

* #### [Coffee Shop Sales Insights](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kainatjamil12/coffe-sale):

This dataset, extracted from Kaggle, comprises individual transaction records from a coffee shop. It includes columns for the date and time of sale (including hour, day, and month), the name of the coffee product sold (coffee_name), the payment method (cash_type), and the revenue generated for that transaction (money). It provides all the necessary details to explore consumer buying patterns and sales trends.  
My idea with this data set is to analyze it and identify the most profitable months, days, and hours of operation. Then, determine the proportion of revenue contributed by specific coffee products during those peak periods.

Had the opportunity to finish high school in Germany thanks to a scholarship from UWC Robert Bosch College from 2020 to 2022. After that, I went to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, where I studied Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology.
